# WorkTimer6

All my project names finish with a number to signify their estimated difficulty; i.e., the six in WorkTimer6

The number is based on the learning website CodeWars' Kata system. There are 11 difficulty levels in CodeWars. The easiest starts at 8Kyu moving up to 1Kyu. Then from 1Dan to the hardest 4Dan. WorkTimer6 signifies Kyu6 difficulty.

This is a simple app I built to help my partner track her work hours. Simply load index.html to a browser and the rest is self explanatory.
